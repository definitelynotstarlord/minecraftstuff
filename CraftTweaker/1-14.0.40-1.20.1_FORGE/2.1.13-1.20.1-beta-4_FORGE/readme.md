### Instructions

- I created these files on the following:
  - CraftTweaker 1.14.0.4
  - Ice and Fire 2.1.13
  - Minecraft 1.20.1 on Forge
- Install CraftTweaker, throw these files in the ...\Scripts\ folder
  - Works

Currently missing some stuff, like the tougness attribute to all armors. Also forgot to add in the "default" values. Oops.
